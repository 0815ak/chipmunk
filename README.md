# logviewer

## what is logviewer?

logviewer is a tool to analyse log files of all kinds. It is built with web technologies. We use it a lot in our daily work.

Logviewer can be used to analyse static logfiles of any kind or open a stream. A stream can be data
coming in from a serial port, from `adb logcat`, from a terminal command.
